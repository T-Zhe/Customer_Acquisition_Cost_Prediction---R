# Customer Acquisition Cost Prediction 

Convenient Food Mart (CFM) is a chain of convenience stores in the United States, with 325 operating stores across the country. However, NASDAQ dropped CFM when the company failed to meet financial report requirements, and the company has been struggling since. 

The objective is to help supermarkets to operate their campaign more effectively. The file CFM_Campaigns.csv contains data on 60k customers. The data can be summarized from those 4 points of view: consumer demographic (gender,marital status,education, e.g.), the basic information about stores(store type, store city, e.g.), the product information they bought(food category,department,store sales&cost), the related information of promotion (media types, media cost, promotion name).

Three models used in this study are: PCA, CLUSTER ANALSYSIS, and LINEAR REGRESSION MODEL.
